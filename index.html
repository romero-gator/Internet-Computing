            <p>
                In this assignment I was tasked with creating a portfolio website that will serve as a homepage to hold links, descriptions, and reflections related to all of my further assignments in this class, CIS 4930: Internet Computing.
                I was also tasked with building a fictitious web-based lesson about a topic I was interested in. This webpage had to contain meaningful content organized in a professional look and feel. The content was required to have embedded
                images that would contribute to the content of the page. Additionally, I had to create at least five assessment items related to the content to test the reader on. These five assessment items would link to another page dedicated
                to responding to the reader's input with appropriate feedback and links to the relevant material. Finally, I had to create a CSS file to organize and standardize the formatting and styling of my webpages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking back at it, this was a great opportunity for me to refresh my HTML and CSS skills which have been dormant for about one year. I enjoyed messing around with new styles and seeing how they affected the look and feel of my webpages.
                I feel much more comfortable using HTML and CSS after completing this assignment. I often found myself spending lots of time searching for assets and researching styles rather than writing HTML or CSS. For instance, I searched for the
                exact images that I wanted for hours and spent tons of time looking at different fonts, sizes, colors, etc. As I become more familiar with HTML and CSS I'm sure my styling abilities will become more efficient.

            <p>
                In this assignment I was tasked with creating a website that took information from the user and processed it in a meaningful way.
                Before coding, I planned out my approach and logic with a structured flowchart. This helped me organize my thoughts and made development faster and easier because I had a predetermined plan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking back at this assignment, I enjoyed coding with Javascript and appreciated the efficiency I gained from making the flowchart. I should've started earlier because I had to relearn a lot of the Javascript because I hadn't used it in so long.
                Nonetheless, I am feeling more and more comfortable with HTML and CSS after completing this assignment. I like how these assignments are building on each other and gaining complexity.

            <p>
                In this assignment I was tasked with creating a simple website that retrieved a list of numbers from the user and produced statistics about those numbers including the mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation, etc.
                I then displayed the statistics in an easy to digest way. I also performed unit tests to ensure my program was producing the correct results.
            </p>
            <p>
                This assignment seemed easier than the previous ones because I had developed a good, reusable form in the previous assignment which I used here. Additionally, the algorithmic style of programming comes easier to me than the tagging and styling because I have a strong foundation with C++.
                Looking back at this assignment, I enjoyed coding with Javascript as it reminded me of C++ which is my favorite language to use. I liked being able to create modular code which I can reuse in the future.

                In this assignment I revamped the contents of assignment 2 with Bootstrap and JQuery. I used Bootsrap to make the webpage more responsive to different device sizes. I also used Bootstrap for its quick and easy styling techniques. I harnessed
                the power of JQuery to manipulate my webpage as the user interacted with it. This took the place of traditional Javascript. I also used JQuery to validate the form fields on my webpage. This allowed me to create a more dynamic experience for the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                After completing this assignment, I have witnessed the power of tools like Bootstrap and JQuery and have experienced how much easier it is to develop webpages with them. I especially liked how easy it was to quickly style the page by using Bootsrap. 
                Using JQuery was easy and simpler than plain Javascript in most cases. I really enjoyed using these tools to make the page more responsive. It had a big impact on the feel of the webpage and certainly enhanced the user experience. I look forward to using these tools in the future.
