            <p>
                In this assignment I was tasked with creating a portfolio website that will serve as a homepage to hold links, descriptions, and reflections related to all of my further assignments in this class, CIS 4930: Internet Computing.
                I was also tasked with building a fictitious web-based lesson about a topic I was interested in. This webpage had to contain meaningful content organized in a professional look and feel. The content was required to have embedded
                images that would contribute to the content of the page. Additionally, I had to create at least five assessment items related to the content to test the reader on. These five assessment items would link to another page dedicated
                to responding to the reader's input with appropriate feedback and links to the relevant material. Finally, I had to create a CSS file to organize and standardize the formatting and styling of my webpages.

            <p>
                Looking back at it, this was a great opportunity for me to refresh my HTML and CSS skills which have been dormant for about one year. I enjoyed messing around with new styles and seeing how they affected the look and feel of my webpages.
                I feel much more comfortable using HTML and CSS after completing this assignment. I often found myself spending lots of time searching for assets and researching styles rather than writing HTML or CSS. For instance, I searched for the
                exact images that I wanted for hours and spent tons of time looking at different fonts, sizes, colors, etc. As I become more familiar with HTML and CSS I'm sure my styling abilities will become more efficient.

            <p>
                In this assignment I was tasked with creating a website that took information from the user and processed it in a meaningful way.
                Before coding, I planned out my approach and logic with a structured flowchart. This helped me organize my thoughts and made development faster and easier because I had a predetermined plan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking back at this assignment, I enjoyed coding with Javascript and appreciated the efficiency I gained from making the flowchart. I should've started earlier because I had to relearn a lot of the Javascript because I hadn't used it in so long.
                Nonetheless, I am feeling more and more comfortable with HTML and CSS after completing this assignment. I like how these assignments are building on each other and gaining complexity.
