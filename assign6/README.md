I was unable to successfully connect the UF server MySQL database that I created to my project...

However, I was able to connect my local MySQL database to the project and complete the assignment. That being said, I don't know how this will work on the UF servers. 

Both MySQL databases (the one I created on mysql.cise.ufl.edu and the one I created on my local machine) have the exact same database relationships, attributes, tables, entries, etc.

I provided my UF server MySQL and local machine configuration information in the code and if you attempt to use it on your own local device, as I did, you will have to change the commented out lines in the following locations:

line 155 in index.php
line 4 in edit.php
line 4 in update.php
line 4 in remove.php
line 4 in process.php

Hopefully you will have better luck connecting with the MySQL database than me...

I'm happy to help at anytime!
