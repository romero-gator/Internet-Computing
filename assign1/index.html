                The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was divided into four houses each associated with a different founder of the school. Students are sorted into one of the 
                four houses by the Sorting Hat which contains the memory of all four founders. The houses are both living and learning communities for its students. They compete throughout
                the school year for the House Cup by earning and losing points for achievements and behavior. Each house has its own common room, dormitory, and unique qualities that separate it from the other houses.

            <p>
                Gryffindor was founded by Godric Gryffindor who was known for his bravery, courage, and outstanding skills in battle. The house colors are scarlet and gold and their 
                emblem features a lion. The common room lies up in Gryffindor Tower and to enter this room you must give the correct passphrase to the guardian painting, the Fat Lady.
                The Gryffindor house ghost is Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington also known as Nearly Headless Nick. He was almost completely beheaded, but the axe was so dull it didn't cut all the way through his neck. 
                He is now a friendly ghost who helps anyone who needs it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Members of Gryffindor possess traits such as nerve, chivalry, bravery, courage, and determination. Some of the wizarding world’s best wizards and witches belonged to 
                this house including Harry Potter, Albus Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Sirius Black, Neville Longbottom, and many more. If you are 
                lucky enough to be sorted into Gryffindor, you are likely the type of person who stands up for the little guy, challenges authority, and has a tendency to act first and think later.

        <div class="glass-container" id="hufflepuff">
            <h2 class="heading">Hufflepuff</h2>
            <img class="hogwarts-img" src="..\Assets\images\hufflepuff.jpg" alt="Hufflepuff common room featuring an bright, sunlit open space filled with plants and a yellow rug" title="Hufflepuff common room">
            <p>
                Hufflepuff was founded by Helga Hufflepuff who was known for being loyal, just, and hard working. The badger is the symbol of this house and its colors are yellow and black.
                The Hufflepuff common room is located near the kitchens in Hogwarts and to enter this room you must tap the correct barrel to the rhythm of 'Helga Hufflepuff'. The Hufflepuff
                house ghost is the Fat Friar who is a kind, jolly, and noble wizard who devoted his life to religion after joining the clergy of a mendicant religious order.
            </p>
            <p>
                Students who get sorted into Hufflepuff are diligent, loyal, kind, patient, modest, and just. Some of the most notable members of Hufflepuff include Cedric Diggory, Pomona Sprout,
                and Newt Scamander. If you find yourself sorted into this house, you’re probably the type of person who has a strong moral compass, always works hard, and is the most loyal friend.

        <div class="glass-container" id="slytherin">
            <h2 class="heading">Slytherin</h2>
            <img class="hogwarts-img" src="..\Assets\images\slytherin.jpg" alt="Slytherin common room featuring large stone walls with medieval ornaments and windows looking into the Black Lake" title="Slytherin common room">
            <p>
                Slytherin was founded by Salazar Slytherin who has an unfortunate reputation. He was a pure-blood wizard known for his cunning and determination. Although, Salazar 
                believed that only pure-blood, magical families deserved to attend Hogwarts, not Muggle-born students. His three friends and co-founders opposed his beliefs forcing him to leave 
                Hogwarts. Before he left, he constructed the Chamber of Secrets, concealing a giant serpentine monster known as a Basilisk which would later unleash horrors upon Muggle-born 
                students. The house colors of Slytherin are silver and green and their emblem features a serpent. The common room can be found down in the dungeons beneath the Black Lake and
                can only be accessed if the correct passphrase is spoken. The house ghost is the Bloody Baron who killed himself after killing the woman he loved, Helena Ravenclaw. He is 
                remorseful of his actions and carries heavy chains as a sign of penance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Members of Slytherin possess traits such as cunning, ambition, pride, resourcefulness, self-preservation, and determination. While it is true that a lot of dark witches and 
                wizards were sorted into Slytherin, not all who belong to this house are bad. Some of the most famous members of Slytherin include Merlin, Lord Voldemort, Severus Snape, 
                Bellatrix Lestrange, Lucius Malfoy, and Draco Malfoy. If the Sorting Hat placed you in Slytherin, then you are most likely the kind of person who is a natural leader, always 
                one step ahead, takes pride in themselves, values reputation, and doesn’t let anyone see their soft side.

            <h2 class="heading">Ravenclaw</h2>
            <img class="hogwarts-img" src="..\Assets\images\ravenclaw.png">
            <p>
                Ravenclaw was founded by Rowena Ravenclaw, the most brilliant witch of her time. Rowena was known for her wisdom, wit, and love of learning. The Ravenclaw colors are 
                blue and bronze and the emblem is an eagle. The common room sits at the top of Ravenclaw Tower behind an enchanted eagle knocker. To get inside, you must answer a riddle asked by
                the eagle knocker. The house ghost of Ravenclaw is Helena Ravenclaw, Rowena's daughter. Helena stole her mother's diadem, a tiara that offers the wearer wisdom, and ran away with it.
                Rowena sent the Bloody Baron, who had feelings of unrequited love for Helena, to retrieve her. Helena refused to return so the Bloody Baron murdered her out of rage then killed himself.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Members of Ravenclaw are wise, eccentric, creative, clever, and love to learn. Some notable witches and wizards from Ravenclaw include Luna Lovegood, Filius Flitwick, Gilderoy Lockhart, Sybill Trelawney, and Garrick Ollivander.
                If you end up in Ravenclaw you are likely an overachiever, curious about the world, obsessed with academic success, and accepting of others.
