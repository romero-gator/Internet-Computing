SQL injections are a common attack vector that uses malicious SQL code for backend database manipulation to access information that was not intended to be displayed. 
This information may include any number of items, including sensitive company data, user lists or private customer details.
It is very important to protect against these kinds of attacks because they are easy to exploit and can lead to leaking private information which can lead to many major problems.
There are several effective ways to prevent SQL injection attacks from taking place. 
The first step is input validation, which is the practice of writing code that can identify illegitimate user inputs. Although this method is rarely foolproof.
To further protect from attacks, a firewall is used to filter out these threats as well as others.

In my project, I used input validation using php to protect against SQL injection attacks. These methods can be found at each location that I connect with and interact with the database.
